### Task: Homepage Section Planning & Assessment

**User Request**: "Okay we are going to do section by section here is a list of all the section we are going to create on the home page [10 sections listed]"

**Actions Taken**:
- Explored current theme structure (Dawn theme base)
- Identified existing sections in `/sections/` directory
- Read current homepage template at `templates/index.json`
- Assessed which existing sections can be reused vs need custom development

**Files Modified**:
- None (assessment phase only)

**Decisions Made**:
- **Keep Hero Section (Section 1) unchanged**: User requested to keep existing image-banner and marquee as-is
- **Reuse existing sections where possible**: Prioritize using Dawn's built-in sections for performance and maintainability
- **Section mapping strategy**:
  - Section 2 (Product Showcase): Use `featured-product.liquid`
  - Section 3 (Story Section): Use `image-with-text.liquid`
  - Section 4 (Product Benefits): Use `multicolumn.liquid`
  - Section 5 (Lifestyle Gallery): Use `collage.liquid` or `multirow.liquid`
  - Section 6 (Testimonials): Use `multicolumn.liquid` (customized)
  - Section 7 (Press Mentions): Use `multicolumn.liquid` or create custom section
  - Section 8 (Community/Instagram): Need custom section or use `collage.liquid`
  - Section 9 (Email Sign-Up): Use existing `email-signup-banner.liquid` or `newsletter.liquid`
  - Section 10 (Footer): Update existing `footer.liquid` with brand tagline

**Rationale**:
- Reusing existing sections maintains theme performance optimization
- Less custom code = easier for client to manage
- Dawn theme sections are already mobile-optimized and accessible
- Can customize appearance via theme settings in Shopify admin

**Blockers/Questions**:
- Need confirmation on approach: reuse existing sections vs create custom sections
- Need to verify activity log documentation process is being followed

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Get user confirmation on section reuse strategy
- [ ] Begin updating `templates/index.json` with new section order
- [ ] Configure each section's settings for Ruche brand aesthetic
- [ ] Create 1-2 custom sections if needed (Press Mentions, Community)
