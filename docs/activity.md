### Task: Homepage Section Planning & Assessment

**User Request**: "Okay we are going to do section by section here is a list of all the section we are going to create on the home page [10 sections listed]"

**Actions Taken**:
- Explored current theme structure (Dawn theme base)
- Identified existing sections in `/sections/` directory
- Read current homepage template at `templates/index.json`
- Assessed which existing sections can be reused vs need custom development

**Files Modified**:
- None (assessment phase only)

**Decisions Made**:
- **Keep Hero Section (Section 1) unchanged**: User requested to keep existing image-banner and marquee as-is
- **Reuse existing sections where possible**: Prioritize using Dawn's built-in sections for performance and maintainability
- **Section mapping strategy**:
  - Section 2 (Product Showcase): Use `featured-product.liquid`
  - Section 3 (Story Section): Use `image-with-text.liquid`
  - Section 4 (Product Benefits): Use `multicolumn.liquid`
  - Section 5 (Lifestyle Gallery): Use `collage.liquid` or `multirow.liquid`
  - Section 6 (Testimonials): Use `multicolumn.liquid` (customized)
  - Section 7 (Press Mentions): Use `multicolumn.liquid` or create custom section
  - Section 8 (Community/Instagram): Need custom section or use `collage.liquid`
  - Section 9 (Email Sign-Up): Use existing `email-signup-banner.liquid` or `newsletter.liquid`
  - Section 10 (Footer): Update existing `footer.liquid` with brand tagline

**Rationale**:
- Reusing existing sections maintains theme performance optimization
- Less custom code = easier for client to manage
- Dawn theme sections are already mobile-optimized and accessible
- Can customize appearance via theme settings in Shopify admin

**Blockers/Questions**:
- Need confirmation on approach: reuse existing sections vs create custom sections
- Need to verify activity log documentation process is being followed

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Get user confirmation on section reuse strategy
- [ ] Begin updating `templates/index.json` with new section order
- [ ] Configure each section's settings for Ruche brand aesthetic
- [ ] Create 1-2 custom sections if needed (Press Mentions, Community)
- [ ] Update footer with brand tagline

### Task: Redesign Product Page with Three-Column Sticky Gallery Layout

**User Request**: "we need to develop a new product page, it should have a gallery, small thumbnails in a column on the left, the selected image large full height middle column, these are sticky, the final column is the product info text, it scrolls, the sticking point should be the navbar + 1 rem"

**Actions Taken**:
- Updated product page sticky positioning to use `top: calc(var(--header-height, 0px) + 1rem)` instead of `top: 0`
- Created new three-column layout class `.product--thumbnail_column` for product pages
- Implemented responsive grid layout: thumbnails (80-100px) | large image (1fr) | product info (300-400px)
- Made thumbnail column sticky with vertical scrolling for many images
- Made large image column sticky with full viewport height minus header
- Product info column scrolls naturally

**Files Modified**:
- ruche-theme/assets/section-main-product.css (updated sticky positioning and added three-column layout)

**Decisions Made**:
- **Sticky positioning**: Uses CSS variable `--header-height` from base.css for accurate navbar offset
- **Three-column grid**: `grid-template-columns: minmax(80px, 100px) 1fr minmax(300px, 400px)`
- **Thumbnail column**: Sticky with max-height and overflow-y: auto for scrolling thumbnails
- **Large image**: Sticky with full viewport height, centered using flexbox
- **Product info**: Natural scrolling column, no max-width restriction
- **Fallback**: Uses `var(--header-height, 0px)` to gracefully handle missing header height variable

**Technical Details**:
- Layout selector: `.product--thumbnail_column` (needs to be set in section settings)
- Grid gap: 2rem between columns
- Thumbnail column: Single column grid (`grid-template-columns: 1fr`)
- Large image height: `calc(100vh - var(--header-height, 0px) - 2rem)`
- Uses `display: contents` on `.product__media-wrapper` to expose children to parent grid
- All sticky elements offset by navbar + 1rem as requested

**To Activate This Layout**:
In Shopify admin, users need to:
1. Go to product page section settings
2. Change "Desktop layout" (media_position) setting to enable this layout
3. OR manually set the product class to include `product--thumbnail_column`

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Test layout on live product page
- [ ] Adjust thumbnail column width if needed (currently 80-100px)
- [ ] Adjust product info column width if needed (currently 300-400px)
- [ ] May need to add this as a selectable option in section schema

**Remaining Homepage Sections**:
1. ✅ Hero Section - kept as-is with marquee
2. ✅ Product Showcase - completed
3. ✅ Story Section - completed
4. ⏳ Product Benefits - 6 benefit icons
5. ⏳ Lifestyle Gallery - 3-4 lifestyle photos
6. ⏳ Testimonials - customer quotes
7. ⏳ Press Mentions - logo grid
8. ⏳ Community/Instagram - UGC feed
9. ⏳ Email Sign-Up - newsletter form
10. ⏳ Footer - brand tagline update

## 2025-10-23 - 14:00

### Task: Redesign Product Page - Thumbnails on Left Side

**User Request**: "we are going to edit the Thumbnail Layout for products... 1. where it sticks, at the moment the whole thing scrolls up a little bit before sticking, i want it to stick at the bottom of the nav bar 2. move the small thumbnails from underneath to the left hand side of the main image 3. tweak screen real estate to get more balanced coverage across the desktop view"

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Initial attempt with thumbnail_column layout** - Discovered this broke the layout (images stacked in rows, thumbnails in wrong spot)
2. **Analyzed existing structure** - Studied `product-media-gallery.liquid` snippet and `.product--thumbnail` CSS
3. **Modified existing thumbnail layout** - Used flexbox to reposition thumbnails from below to left side
4. **Fixed sticky positioning** - Changed from `top: calc(var(--header-height) + 1rem)` to `top: var(--header-height)` to stick at navbar bottom
5. **Forced column layout** - Overrode grid styles with `!important` to ensure vertical thumbnail column
6. **Adjusted thumbnail width** - Changed from 140px to 80px for better proportions

**Files Modified**:
- ruche-theme/assets/section-main-product.css (added `.product--thumbnail` flexbox layout, updated sticky positioning)
- ruche-theme/templates/product.json (kept as `"gallery_layout": "thumbnail"`)

**Decisions Made**:
- **Abandoned `.product--thumbnail_column` approach** - HTML structure didn't support the CSS Grid three-column layout properly
- **Work within existing `.product--thumbnail` layout** - Shopify's built-in thumbnail layout shows only active image + thumbnails
- **Thumbnail positioning**:
  - Width: 80px (down from 140px for better screen balance)
  - Position: Left side using flexbox `order: -1`
  - Layout: Vertical column using `flex-direction: column !important`
  - Gap: 1rem between thumbnails
  - Sticky at: `top: var(--header-height)` (no extra offset)
- **Sticky behavior**:
  - Thumbnails stick at navbar bottom with `top: var(--header-height, 0px)`
  - Max height: `calc(100vh - var(--header-height, 0px))` for scrollable thumbnail column
  - Main image gallery remains in natural flow

**Technical Details**:
```css
.product--thumbnail media-gallery {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2rem;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

.product--thumbnail .thumbnail-slider {
  order: -1;
  width: 80px;
  position: sticky;
  top: var(--header-height, 0px);
  max-height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height, 0px));
  overflow-y: auto;
}

.product--thumbnail .thumbnail-list {
  display: flex !important;
  flex-direction: column !important;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

**Issues Discovered**:
- `thumbnail_column` layout wasn't ready for production (stacked all images, weird thumbnail positioning)
- Generic `.thumbnail-list` grid styles were overriding custom column layout
- Sticky positioning had extra 1rem offset causing scroll-up before sticking
- Needed `!important` overrides to force column layout over default grid

**Testing & Deployment**:
- Pushed changes to Shopify theme #136720220226
- User confirmed thumbnails now display in vertical column on left
- Sticky positioning issue noted: currently sticks at top of viewport instead of bottom of navbar

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Debug sticky positioning - currently sticking at viewport top, not navbar bottom
- [ ] Verify `--header-height` CSS variable is being set correctly
- [ ] May need to add padding offset to account for navbar height

**Remaining Homepage Sections**:
1. ✅ Hero Section - kept as-is with marquee
2. ✅ Product Showcase - completed
3. ✅ Story Section - completed
4. ⏳ Product Benefits - 6 benefit icons
5. ⏳ Lifestyle Gallery - 3-4 lifestyle photos
6. ⏳ Testimonials - customer quotes
7. ⏳ Press Mentions - logo grid
8. ⏳ Community/Instagram - UGC feed
9. ⏳ Email Sign-Up - newsletter form
10. ⏳ Footer - brand tagline update

### Task: Fix Product Page Sticky Positioning & Navbar Transparency

**User Request**: "the sticky point is still top of page not bottom of navbar, what could be causing that. also navbar should turn white background from first scroll, it happens on homepage, it should just be the same"

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Debugged sticky positioning issue** - Found `--header-height` CSS variable was set to `0px`
2. **Root cause analysis** - JavaScript was querying `.section-header` element which had `position: sticky` but no actual height
3. **Fixed JavaScript measurement** - Updated `ruche-custom.js` to measure `.header` element (actual header content) instead of `.section-header` wrapper
4. **Added fallback chain** - JS now tries `.header` → `.header-wrapper` → `.section-header` → fallback to 80px
5. **Set default CSS value** - Added `--header-height: 80px` to `:root` in both `ruche-branding.css` and `section-main-product.css`
6. **Removed CSS fallbacks** - Changed `var(--header-height, 0px)` to `var(--header-height)` to use `:root` default instead of `0px` fallback
7. **Fixed navbar transparency** - Updated scroll behavior to add white background immediately on any scroll for all pages (not just homepage with banner)
8. **Added 1rem padding** - Updated header height calculation to add 16px below navbar for natural spacing

**Files Modified**:
- ruche-theme/assets/ruche-custom.js (fixed header height detection and scroll behavior)
- ruche-theme/assets/ruche-branding.css (added `--header-height: 80px` default)
- ruche-theme/assets/section-main-product.css (added `:root` default, removed `0px` fallbacks)

**Decisions Made**:
- **CSS Variable Strategy**: Set `--header-height: 80px` in `:root` as fallback, then update dynamically with JavaScript
- **Element to measure**: `.header` element (has actual content and height) not `.section-header` (wrapper with no height)
- **Fallback chain**: Try multiple elements to ensure we always get a valid height
- **Retry timing**: Call `setHeaderHeight()` at 3 points: DOMContentLoaded, +100ms, +500ms to handle async rendering
- **Padding offset**: Add 16px (1rem) to header height for natural spacing between navbar and sticky elements
- **Navbar behavior**: Unified across all pages - white background on any scroll, not just after hero section

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
function setHeaderHeight() {
  let headerHeight = 0;
  if (headerElement && headerElement.offsetHeight > 0) {
    headerHeight = headerElement.offsetHeight;
  } else if (header && header.offsetHeight > 0) {
    headerHeight = header.offsetHeight;
  } else if (sectionHeader && sectionHeader.offsetHeight > 0) {
    headerHeight = sectionHeader.offsetHeight;
  } else {
    headerHeight = 80;
  }
  const headerWithPadding = headerHeight + 16;
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--header-height', `${headerWithPadding}px`);
}
```

**Issues Resolved**:
1. ✅ Sticky elements now position below navbar instead of at viewport top
2. ✅ Header height correctly calculated (was 0px, now actual height + 16px padding)
3. ✅ Navbar turns white on scroll for all pages (homepage and product pages)
4. ✅ 1rem natural padding between navbar and sticky content

**Testing & Verification**:
- Console log confirmed: "Using .header element, height: [actual height]px"
- Sticky positioning now works correctly with navbar offset + 1rem padding
- Navbar transparency transitions consistently across all pages

**Next Steps**:
- [x] Sticky positioning fixed and working correctly
- [x] Navbar transparency unified across all pages
- [ ] Continue with remaining homepage sections

### Task: Add Slide-Up Animation to Hero Product Overlay

**User Request**: "lets do a github push" → "i want to animate the home page, lets start with the middle image overlay on the hero section"

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Identified overlay element** - Found `.banner__product-overlay` in `image-banner.liquid` (lines 167-177)
2. **Discovered duplicate CSS issue** - Found conflicting styles in both `section-image-banner.css` AND `ruche-branding.css`
3. **Root cause: `!important` flags** - `ruche-branding.css` had all styles set with `!important`, blocking any modifications
4. **Removed transform conflict** - Removed `transform: translate(-50%, -50%) !important;` from base style to allow animation
5. **Added slide-up animation** - Created `@keyframes slideUpFadeIn` that starts 60px below final position
6. **Repositioned overlay** - Changed from `top: 50%` to `top: 75%` to lower it in the hero section
7. **Cleaned up duplicate CSS** - Removed all overlay styles from `section-image-banner.css` to avoid duplication

**Files Modified**:
- ruche-theme/assets/ruche-branding.css (updated overlay positioning, added slide-up animation)
- ruche-theme/assets/section-image-banner.css (removed duplicate overlay styles)

**Decisions Made**:
- **Single source of truth**: Keep all overlay styles in `ruche-branding.css` only
- **Overlay position**: 75% down the hero section (was 50% centered)
- **Animation**: Slide up 60px while fading in over 1.2s with cubic-bezier easing
- **Delay**: 0.4s delay before animation starts
- **Why animation works now**: Removed the static `transform !important` that was blocking keyframe transforms

**Technical Details**:
```css
.banner__product-overlay {
  position: absolute !important;
  left: 50% !important;
  top: 75% !important;
  width: 16.666% !important;
  z-index: 10 !important;
  pointer-events: none !important;
  opacity: 0;
  animation: slideUpFadeIn 1.2s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) 0.4s forwards;
}

@keyframes slideUpFadeIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translate(-50%, calc(-50% + 60px));
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  }
}
```

**Issues Resolved**:
1. ✅ Animation wasn't working - static `transform: translate(-50%, -50%) !important;` was blocking animation
2. ✅ Position wasn't changing - `!important` flags in `ruche-branding.css` were overriding everything
3. ✅ Duplicate CSS - removed all overlay styles from `section-image-banner.css`

**Testing & Deployment**:
- Pushed to Shopify theme #136720220226
- Pushed to GitHub: commit `8b692bb` "feat: add slide-up animation to hero product overlay"

**Animation Behavior**:
- Overlay starts at 75% + 60px (below final position)
- Slides up 60px while fading from 0 to 1 opacity
- Takes 1.2s with smooth cubic-bezier easing
- Starts after 0.4s delay (allows hero images to load first)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Review animation on live site
- [ ] Consider animating other homepage elements (heading, buttons, etc.)
- [ ] Continue with remaining homepage sections

### Task: Fix Sticky Scroll Reveal Section - Entry/Exit Scroll Control

**User Request**: "i have a section that reveals segments on scroll... there are multiple issues: scrolling into the first section from a different section kind of speeds past the first segment of this section, scrolling out of the section is not happening, so need to handle first & last for the animations"

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Analyzed existing implementation** - Read `sticky-scroll-reveal.js`, `sticky-scroll-reveal.liquid`, and `section-sticky-scroll-reveal.css`
2. **Identified core issues**:
   - Entry: Wheel control activated too early, causing immediate navigation before landing on first segment
   - Exit: Boundary checks existed but were blocked by cooldown, preventing smooth exit
   - IntersectionObserver was interfering with wheel control, causing segment skipping
   - Smooth scrolling triggered wheel events during animation, causing unwanted navigation
   - Scroll-snap CSS was preventing exit at boundaries
3. **Fixed entry behavior**:
   - Added `hasEntered` state flag to track when section control should activate
   - Added 300ms grace period after entering to allow natural settling on first segment
   - Modified IntersectionObserver to skip transition on initial entry (instant snap to first segment)
   - Only activate wheel control when section is halfway into viewport AND grace period has passed
4. **Fixed exit behavior**:
   - Added `isExiting` state flag that persists until fully outside section
   - Moved boundary exit checks BEFORE cooldown check for immediate exit response
   - Disabled scroll-snap CSS when at boundaries by removing `.has-sticky-scroll` class
   - Exit state prevents all wheel control until section is completely out of viewport
5. **Fixed IntersectionObserver interference**:
   - Added guard: `if (this.hasEntered) return;` in observer callback
   - Observer now only activates blocks during entry phase, not during wheel control
6. **Fixed smooth scroll interference**:
   - Added `isProgrammaticScroll` flag to block wheel events during `scrollIntoView()` animation
   - Flag set for 1000ms after each navigation to allow smooth scroll to complete
   - Prevents wheel event flood during animation from triggering unwanted navigation
7. **Added comprehensive debug logging**:
   - Console logs for all state transitions (entry, exit, navigation, cooldown)
   - Emoji indicators for easy visual scanning (🎯 🔄 ⏸️ ⬆️ ⬇️ 🚫 etc.)
   - `DEBUG = true` flag for easy enable/disable (line 39)

**Files Modified**:
- ruche-theme/assets/sticky-scroll-reveal.js (refactored scroll control logic)

**State Flags Added**:
- `hasEntered` - Tracks if section control is active (set when halfway into viewport)
- `enteredTime` - Timestamp when entered, used for 300ms grace period
- `isProgrammaticScroll` - Blocks wheel events during smooth scroll animation
- `isExiting` - Persistent flag that disables all control until fully outside section

**Technical Details**:

**Entry Flow**:
```javascript
// 1. Scroll into viewport
if (!isVisible) {
  hasEntered = false; isExiting = false; return;
}

// 2. Entry phase - allow natural scroll
if (!hasEntered) {
  if (rect.top <= window.innerHeight * 0.5) {
    hasEntered = true; enteredTime = now;
    return; // Allow one more natural scroll
  }
  return; // Still entering
}

// 3. Grace period - prevent immediate navigation
if (now - enteredTime < 300) {
  return; // Allow natural settling
}

// 4. Wheel control now active
```

**Exit Flow**:
```javascript
// At boundaries - set exit flag
if (scrollingDown && currentIndex >= textBlocks.length - 1) {
  document.documentElement.classList.remove('has-sticky-scroll');
  isExiting = true;
  return; // Allow scroll out
}

// While exiting - block all control
if (isExiting) {
  return; // Allow natural scroll
}

// Reset only when fully outside
if (!isVisible) {
  hasEntered = false; isExiting = false;
}
```

**Navigation Flow**:
```javascript
// Set flag to block wheel events
isProgrammaticScroll = true;

// Smooth scroll to segment
textBlocks[targetIndex].scrollIntoView({
  behavior: 'smooth',
  block: 'center'
});

// Clear flag after animation completes
setTimeout(() => {
  isProgrammaticScroll = false;
}, 1000);
```

**Debugging**:
Console logs available:
- 🎯 Navigating (from/to/direction)
- 🔄 Activating block (index, skipTransition, previousIndex)
- ⏸️ Cooldown active
- ⬆️ At first segment - allowing exit up
- ⬇️ At last segment - allowing exit down
- 🚪 Exiting section - allowing natural scroll
- 🚫 Outside section - resetting
- ⏭️ Entry phase - allowing natural scroll
- ✅ Entering section - hasEntered set to true
- ⏳ Entry grace period - allowing natural scroll

**Issues Resolved**:
1. ✅ Entry no longer skips first segment - grace period allows natural landing
2. ✅ Exit works smoothly at both top and bottom boundaries
3. ✅ IntersectionObserver doesn't interfere with manual navigation
4. ✅ Smooth scroll animation doesn't trigger unwanted segment changes
5. ✅ Scroll-snap releases at boundaries to allow free exit
6. ✅ No more bouncing back into section after trying to exit

**Testing & Verification**:
- Tested entry from above: smooth scroll to first segment, no skip
- Tested exit upward: immediate release, no stall
- Tested exit downward: smooth exit from last segment
- Tested re-entry after exit: clean reset and proper entry flow
- All state transitions logged correctly in console

**Next Steps**:
- [x] Entry/exit behavior fixed
- [x] Debug logging added for troubleshooting
- [ ] Monitor for edge cases in production
- [ ] Disable debug logging when stable (set `DEBUG = false` at line 39)
- [ ] Continue with remaining homepage sections

**Remaining Homepage Sections**:
1. ✅ Hero Section - kept as-is with marquee

### Task: Global Scroll Snap Implementation & Removal

**User Request**: "I want to create a section by section scroll snap, so each scroll the next section lands perfectly with its top aligned to the header. It should also factor in sticky-scroll-reveal.js and not break that."

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created global scroll snap system with CSS and JavaScript
2. Added comprehensive debugging for scroll behavior
3. Attempted multiple approaches to prevent conflicts with sticky-scroll-reveal
4. Ultimately removed global scroll snap due to conflicts

**Files Created**:
- `assets/scroll-snap.css` - Global scroll snap styles (later disabled)
- `assets/scroll-snap.js` - Scroll snap monitor with DEBUG logging (kept for potential future use)

**Files Modified**:
- `layout/theme.liquid` - Added scroll-snap CSS/JS includes
- `sections/sticky-scroll-reveal.liquid` - Added/removed IntersectionObserver for scroll snap control
- `assets/section-sticky-scroll-reveal.css` - Removed scroll-snap-align override
- `assets/section-marquee.css` - Removed scroll-snap-align override

**Approaches Attempted**:
1. ✅ Global `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` on html
2. ✅ `scroll-padding-top: var(--header-height)` for header offset
3. ✅ `scroll-snap-align: start` on all `.shopify-section` elements
4. ❌ `scroll-snap-align: none` on sticky-scroll-reveal section
5. ❌ `scroll-snap-align: none` on marquee section (too small)
6. ❌ `html.has-sticky-scroll { scroll-snap-type: none }` to disable during sticky section
7. ❌ IntersectionObserver with `rootMargin: 200px/100%` to disable snap early
8. ❌ 300ms delay before re-enabling snap after exiting sticky section

**Issues Encountered**:
- Global scroll snap fought with sticky-scroll-reveal's wheel hijacking
- Entry to sticky section would skip segment 0 and jump to segment 1
- Text would disappear during transitions
- Marquee section would snap during sticky section entry/grace period
- Short sections caused unpredictable snapping behavior
- Multiple sections visible simultaneously caused snap conflicts
- Re-enabling snap after sticky section caused aggressive jumping

**Decisions Made**:
- **Removed global scroll snap entirely** - conflicts outweighed benefits
- **Kept scroll-snap.css with only smooth scrolling** - file preserved for future use
- **Kept scroll-snap.js for debugging** - useful logging for scroll behavior analysis
- **Sticky-scroll-reveal remains standalone** - its custom wheel control works perfectly in isolation

**Final State**:
- `scroll-snap.css`: Only contains `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- `scroll-snap.js`: Monitoring tool (can be disabled by setting `DEBUG = false`)
- `sticky-scroll-reveal.liquid`: Clean, no IntersectionObserver clutter
- All scroll-snap-align overrides removed from section CSS files

**Debugging Features Added** (scroll-snap.js):
- 🎯 Scroll Snap Monitor initialization
- 📏 Header height tracking with CSS variable
- 📍 Section snap detection with dimensions
- 🎨 Sticky scroll reveal section detection
- ✅ Scroll settled events
- Section height and viewport comparison
- `isShort` flag for sections < 50vh

**Rationale**:
- Native scroll-snap-type interferes with custom JavaScript scroll control
- Sticky-scroll-reveal requires precise wheel event handling incompatible with snap points
- Natural scrolling provides better UX than fighting snap conflicts
- Smooth scroll behavior sufficient for polished feel

**Lessons Learned**:
- CSS scroll-snap and JavaScript wheel hijacking don't mix well
- IntersectionObserver timing is hard to predict for scroll control
- Sometimes simpler is better - remove features that cause more problems than they solve

**Next Steps**:
- [x] Global scroll snap removed
- [x] Sticky-scroll-reveal working smoothly
- [ ] Monitor natural scroll behavior in production
- [ ] Consider scroll-snap only for non-interactive sections in future
- [ ] Continue with remaining homepage sections
