**IMPORTANT**: All theme development work must be done in the `ruche-theme/` directory. The root `ruche-shopify/` folder is for documentation, branding assets, and project management only.

## Development Priorities
1. **Performance First**: Every decision should prioritize speed
2. **Brand Consistency**: All elements must match Ruche aesthetic
3. **Mobile Experience**: Design mobile-first, enhance for desktop
4. **Conversion Optimization**: Focus on user journey and reducing friction
5. **Maintainability**: Client should be able to manage content easily

## Key Constraints
- 10-15 products only (small catalog)
- Budget-conscious: Starting with Shopify Basic plan
- Client will self-manage after launch
- Australian market focus
- Must integrate seamlessly with Klaviyo for email automation

## Questions to Ask Before Coding
1. Does this improve performance or hurt it?
2. Does this match the Ruche brand aesthetic?
3. Will the client be able to update this themselves?
4. Is this mobile-friendly?
5. Does this help conversion or create friction?

## Success Metrics
- Lighthouse Performance Score: 90+
- Mobile Performance Score: 85+
- Abandoned Cart Recovery Rate: 10-15%
- Email Revenue Attribution: 25-40% of total sales
- Page Load Time: Under 2 seconds
