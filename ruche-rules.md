# 🪞 Ruche Brand Rules  
_For the woman behind the mother._

---

## 1. Brand Essence
**Tagline:** _For the woman behind the mother._  
**Purpose:** Elevate motherhood through design that is chic, safe, and effortless.  
**Core Idea:** Parent-first design that merges fashion and functionality.  
**Voice:** Confident, editorial, and quietly luxurious.  
**Values:** Style • Safety • Minimalism • Functionality • Respect for motherhood • Care for the carer.

---

## 2. Tone of Voice
| Attribute | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Voice** | Sophisticated yet approachable — think _Vogue meets motherhood_. |
| **Personality** | Calm, fashion-literate, intentional, supportive. |
| **Avoid** | Babyish clichés, corporate jargon, loud marketing hype. |
| **Grammar** | Use em-dashes, rhythmic short sentences, and minimal adjectives. |
| **Examples** | “Because she’s not just a mum. She’s a Ruche mum.”<br>“Antibacterial. Chic. Parent-first.” |

Use tone to communicate calm authority. Every sentence should feel _considered_, not casual.

---

## 3. Key Brand Messages
1. **Style is part of the story** – Design should elevate motherhood, not compromise it.  
2. **Safety is non-negotiable** – Vegan, antibacterial, eco-conscious materials.  
3. **Minimal design that gives you more** – Smarter, multifunctional, made to last.  
4. **Luxury should be lived in** – Practical doesn’t have to look plain.  
5. **Motherhood deserves respect** – Empower the woman behind the mother.

## 4. Visual & Design Rules
### Palette
| Colour | HEX | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Black** | `#3D3935` | Core tone for text and grounding. |
| **Grey** | `#545859` | Secondary neutral. |
| **Off White** | `#E6BC75` | Warm highlight for accents or background. |

**Principle:** Quiet luxury — restrained, tonal, and high contrast for legibility.

### Typography
- **Primary:** Arpona (Serif) – Headlines and hero statements.  
- **Secondary:** Neue Haas Grotesk – Body copy.  
- **Accent:** This Reality (Script) – Rare, expressive use (quotes, highlights).  
Maintain a clear hierarchy: Arpona → Neue Haas → This Reality.

### Imagery
- Editorial, candid, and aspirational — never staged or overly domestic.  
- Mums in motion: cafés, city walks, gentle light.  
- Style: clean lines, timeless tailoring, tactile textures.  
- Avoid cliché baby photography; focus on _the woman behind the mother_.

### Graphic Elements
- Collage motifs: torn paper, layered textures, soft edges.  
- Tessellated brandmark pattern for subtle backdrops.  
- Minimal embellishment; let typography and composition breathe.

---

## 5. Writing Guidelines
- Lead with **benefit-driven storytelling**, not specs.  
- Use **short, rhythmic phrasing** that feels natural when spoken aloud.  
- Always position the mother as the **hero** — products are supporting cast.  
- Emphasise **design, material, and lifestyle fit.**  
- Every line should express **chic practicality**: stylish _and_ smart.  

### Example Transformations
| Functional Copy | Ruche Style |
|-----------------|--------------|
| “Waterproof changing mat.” | “Antibacterial. Chic. Parent-first.” |
| “Durable, easy to clean.” | “Wipes clean in seconds. Designed to last.” |
| “Stylish for modern mums.” | “Because she’s not just a mum. She’s a Ruche mum.” |

---

## 6. Brand Behaviour
- Speak with **assurance, not persuasion.**  
- Always **centre empathy** — respect the woman’s lifestyle and intelligence.  
- Avoid over-explaining; trust brevity.  
- When describing visuals or direction, imagine the pages of a fashion editorial.

---

## 7. Creative Guardrails for AI Tools
When writing, designing, or generating creative assets under the Ruche brand:
- Mirror Arpona’s elegance — sentences should _look_ clean and balanced.
- Default to **monotone, soft-contrast colour palettes.**
- Use **fashion-inspired composition** for visuals (soft lighting, editorial crops).
- Keep tone **quiet, stylish, supportive** — never exclamatory or salesy.
- Always reinforce: _“Ruche is not a baby brand, it’s a lifestyle for modern mums.”_

---

## 8. Summary
Ruche communicates **editorial polish with lived-in authenticity**.  
Its world is calm, tactile, and confident — where motherhood and style coexist beautifully.
